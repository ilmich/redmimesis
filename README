Mimesis is a simple but powerful flat file database for php.
Many of its strengths and weaknesses are common to all databases of this type, but
has a couple of features that make it special:

- can be used as a database keyword / value that can store PHP objects, or simple strings
- works with low-level file by inserting new keys at the bottom the file, this makes it very fast even with amounts of data considerable
- is written in pure PHP, so there are no strange requirements

Redmimesis is a wrapper that implements functionality similar to the famous database key/value REDIS.

Currently only a small set of features has been reproduced, but over time I hope to develop other.
